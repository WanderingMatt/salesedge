          <p>SalesEdge's sole purpose is to increase your productivity and enhance your sales efforts. Uncompromising quality in our services, focus, and a dedication to your overall satisfaction sets us apart.</p>
          <p>We open doors for you.</p>

        <h2>The Corporation</h2>
        <p>SalesEdge develops an interest in our clients' products and / or services at the senior executive level of their primary target market.</p>
        <p>With extensive experience in sales and business relationships, professional staff employ our unique process to set viable and valuable initial sales meetings for companies in a variety of business sectors.</p>
        <h2>Products and Services</h2>
        <p>SalesEdge introduces your products and services to interested executives in your key prospective markets.  The right kind of sales meetings result in increased sales for your firm.</p>
        <p>Our experienced professionals know how to get through to executives at prospective clients.  When they do, a carefully worded script explains the value proposition and interested executives will ask for a meeting with a representative from your firm.  Our meeting brokers do not sell meetings, because we clearly understand that you don't want your representatives traveling to meetings that have been pushed upon the prospect.  We only schedule meetings with interested executives who feel that you may be able to solve a problem, add value or save them money.  We do not attempt to qualify over the phone because our meeting brokers are not experts in your business.  If asked a question, we will say: "I have written your question down and it will be addressed at the meeting".</p>
        <p>In addition, we collect 'requests for information' from interested parties and fulfill them with your materials or pass them on to your staff.</p>
        <p>When sales professionals meet with highly interested prospects, they close more business.</p>
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>You provide the prospect criteria and approve the cold-call database.  We collaborate on the development of the brief introductory script and you approve it.  You provide us with current meeting calendars for your participating sales professionals, meeting frequency guidelines, and any travel considerations.  We set the meetings, confirm the meetings via e-mail, and later reconfirm via telephone.  Keeping you, our client, appraised at all times.</p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>For over ten years SalesEdge has contributed to positive sales gains for domestic and international corporations.  Clients include Advanced Utility Systems, Alexander Proudfoot, BDO Dunwoody, Borland, Cambridge Management, Cognos, Computer Associates, Datasym, Dell, Deloitte &amp; Touche, DigiDyne, DoubleClick, Ernst &amp; Young, Hewlett Packard, Hyperion, J.D. Edwards, Monster.com, Netstar, Oracle, Platinum Technologies, Points.com, SAS, Sterling Commerce, Sun Microsystems and Thompson Corporation.</p>
        <h2>The Case for Introductory Services</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Sales people do not cold-call on a regular basis because they dislike it.</li>
          <li>Sales people who meet regularly with interested senior executives at prospective companies sell more.</li>
          <li>Real sales producers are hard to find.  Retain them and increase their success rate with services from SalesEdge.</li>
        </ul>
